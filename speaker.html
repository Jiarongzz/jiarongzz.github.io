         Dr. Jeff Hemsley <br />
          Interim Dean, Associate Professor <br />

        <p class="greeting">Dear Dr. Jeff Hemsley,</p>

        <p>
          My name is Jiarong Zhang, and I currently work as a data analyst at Huawei. 
          I am also a former student of the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University. I am writing to invite you 
          to speak at one of our upcoming professional development seminars for our analytics and AI teams.
        </p>

        <p>
         Our team often invites guest speakers to help connect academic research with real industry practice. 
         Your work on information flow, social media analytics, and data visualization closely relates to the 
         problems we face in our daily work. We believe your experience would give our engineers and analysts
          valuable insight and new perspectives.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also hope this visit can create a meaningful exchange between industry and academia. Our teams 
          work with large-scale, real-world data, and these practical challenges may also be useful for your
          research. At the same time, we would greatly benefit from learning from your expertise. We see this 
          as a good opportunity for future collaboration.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are happy to provide an honorarium, as well as travel and accommodation support. We understand 
          that you have a very busy schedule, so we are happy to arrange the event at any time that is most 
          convenient for you, whether in person or virtually. It would be a pleasure to welcome you to speak 
          with our team.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I hope we will have the opportunity to host you.
        </p>

        <p class="closing">
          Sincerely,<br /><br />
          <strong>Jiarong Zhang</strong>
