        <p class="greeting">Dear Human Resources Team,</p>

        <p>
          I am currently a senior at Syracuse University in the United States, majoring in Applied Data 
          Science. I am writing to apply for the Data Science Engineer position at Huawei. I am highly 
          interested in using data and analytics to support real business decisions and contribute to large-scale 
          products, and I believe my technical background and hands-on experience align well with this role.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy working closely with product and business teams to solve practical problems. I am particularly 
          interested in turning raw data into actionable insights — identifying user behavior trends, improving 
          operational efficiency, and supporting growth decisions with clear metrics. Growing up in Shenzhen, I 
          am also familiar with the fast-paced technology and business environment in China, which helps me better 
          understand local markets and user needs.
        </p>

        <p>
        Through my coursework and projects, I have developed strong skills in SQL, Python, and data engineering
         workflows. I have built ETL pipelines, cleaned and structured messy datasets, and designed dashboards and 
         analytical tools to help users quickly understand key metrics and patterns. As a Teaching Assistant for a 
         SQL course, I also strengthened my understanding of relational data modeling and learned how to explain co
         mplex technical concepts clearly and effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
         Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss 
         how I can contribute to your team.
        </p>

        <p class="closing">
          Sincerely,<br /><br />
          <strong>Jiarong Zhang</strong>
